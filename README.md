# Pickleball Match Tracker

A modern, mobile-first web application for managing pickleball matches with AI-powered matchmaking. Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase.

## üöÄ Features

- **Player Management**: Add, edit, and manage player profiles with skill scores
- **AI Match Generator**: Advanced algorithm considering fatigue, gender balance, and session planning
- **Match Recording**: Record match results with automatic score recalculation
- **Statistics**: Track player performance and match history
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for mobile devices with responsive layout

## üß† Advanced Matchmaking Algorithm

The AI-powered matchmaking algorithm ensures fair, balanced, and engaging matches by considering multiple factors:

### üéØ **Core Benefits**

#### **1. Fair Team Balance**
- **Skill-Based Matching**: Teams are balanced based on player skill scores (0-10 scale)
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Uses ELO-like rating system that adapts to player performance
- **Optimal Combinations**: Evaluates all possible team combinations to find the most balanced matchups

#### **2. Player Fatigue Management**
- **Consecutive Match Prevention**: Prevents players from playing too many consecutive matches
- **Rest Periods**: Ensures players get adequate rest between matches
- **Gender-Specific Fatigue**: Different fatigue factors for male (0.2) and female (0.3) players
- **Small Pool Optimization**: Adapts rules for small groups (5-6 players) vs larger groups

#### **3. Session Planning Intelligence**
- **Multi-Match Optimization**: Plans entire sessions, not just individual matches
- **Player Rotation**: Ensures all players participate equally throughout the session
- **Team Variety**: Minimizes repeated team partnerships to keep matches fresh
- **Time Management**: Automatically calculates optimal number of matches based on session duration

#### **4. Smart Player Selection**
- **Priority-Based Selection**: Players who haven't played get highest priority
- **Consecutive Match Limits**: Maximum 2-3 consecutive matches depending on pool size
- **Forced Rotation**: For small pools, implements forced player rotation between matches
- **Balance Override**: Team balance takes precedence over other factors when necessary

### üîß **Algorithm Features**

#### **Weighted Scoring System**
- **Consecutive Match Penalty**: Highest priority (1000-2000x multiplier)
- **Team Balance Score**: Second priority (100x multiplier for score differences)
- **Fatigue Penalty**: Low priority (0.5x multiplier)
- **No Rest Penalty**: Low priority (0.3x multiplier)
- **Team Repetition Penalty**: Moderate priority (10x multiplier)

#### **Adaptive Behavior**
- **Small Pool Logic**: Relaxes rest rules for 5-6 players while maintaining fairness
- **Large Pool Logic**: Stricter consecutive match limits for 7+ players
- **Dynamic Match Count**: Calculates optimal matches based on session duration and match length
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful handling when ideal conditions can't be met

#### **Real-Time Optimization**
- **Live Score Updates**: Player ratings adjust after each match
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors player participation and performance
- **Session Continuity**: Maintains session state across multiple matches
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows current match and session progress

### üìä **Algorithm Performance**

The algorithm has been optimized for:
- **Fairness**: Ensures balanced teams and equal player participation
- **Engagement**: Keeps matches competitive and interesting
- **Efficiency**: Fast generation even with complex constraints
- **Flexibility**: Adapts to different group sizes and session lengths
- **Reliability**: Handles edge cases and provides fallback options

  )
);
```

## üìÅ Supabase Storage Setup

### 1. Create Storage Bucket
In your Supabase dashboard, go to Storage and create a new bucket:
- **Bucket name**: `images`
- **Public bucket**: ‚úÖ (checked)
- **File size limit**: 10MB
- **Allowed MIME types**: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`

### 2. Storage Policies
Add the following RLS policies to your `images` bucket:

**Allow public read access:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public Access" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'images');
```

**Allow public uploads (no authentication required):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public Upload" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'images');
```

**Allow public updates:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public Update" ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE USING (bucket_id = 'images');
```

**Allow public deletes:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public Delete" ON storage.objects FOR DELETE USING (bucket_id = 'images');
```

**Note**: These policies allow public access to the storage bucket. If you plan to add authentication later, you should update these policies to be more restrictive.

### 3. Folder Structure
The app will automatically create the following folder structure:
```
images/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ avatars/          # Player profile pictures
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## üéØ Usage

### Player Management
1. Navigate to the "Players" tab
2. Click "Add Player" to create new player profiles
3. Set initial skill scores (default: 5.0, range: 0.0-10.0)
4. Edit or delete players as needed

### Match Generation
1. Go to the "Match Generator" tab
2. Configure session parameters:
   - Session duration (minutes)
   - Match duration (minutes)
3. Click "Generate Session" to create multiple matches
4. Review the generated match schedule

### Match Recording
1. Visit the "Match Recording" tab
2. Generate a new match or select from existing ones
3. Record final scores for both teams
4. Save results to update player scores automatically

## üé® Styling Guidelines

### Mobile-First CSS Classes
```css
/* Responsive spacing */
.space-mobile { @apply space-y-4 sm:space-y-6; }
.gap-mobile { @apply gap-3 sm:gap-4; }

/* Responsive text */
.text-responsive { @apply text-sm sm:text-base; }
.text-responsive-lg { @apply text-base sm:text-lg; }

/* Mobile-friendly grid */
.grid-mobile { @apply grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3; }
```

### Component Structure
- Use `flex-col sm:flex-row` for responsive layouts
- Apply `w-full sm:w-auto` for responsive buttons
- Use `text-sm sm:text-base` for responsive typography
- Implement `p-4 sm:p-6` for responsive padding

2. Use mobile-first Tailwind classes
3. Test on mobile devices
4. Add responsive breakpoints as needed

### Mobile Testing
- Test on actual mobile devices
- Use browser dev tools mobile emulation
- Verify touch interactions work properly
- Check performance on slower devices

## üöÄ Deployment

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploy to Vercel
1. Connect your GitHub repository
